Peaknuckle rules
================

Special cards:
--------------

- 2: next player picks up 2 cards. If they have a 2, they can instead pass the penalty to the next player, who must pick up 4. This can be chained as many times as you like!
- 3: same rule as 2, but the next player picks up 3 cards!
  - 2 / 3 chaining: a 2 can be chained onto a 3 (or vica-verca) only if the cards share the same suit.
