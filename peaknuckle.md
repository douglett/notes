Peaknuckle rules
----------------

Special cards:

- 2: next player picks up 2 cards. If they have a 2, they can instead pass the penalty to the next player, who must pick up 4.
- 3: same rule as 2, but the next player picks up 3 cards!
- 7: change suit. this can be played on top of any card (unless special rules are in effect).
- 10: next player misses a go. If the next player has a 10, they can cancel the penalty, passing on the missed turn.
- Jack: reverse turn order.
- King: take another turn immediately. Normal rules apply. If you can't play a card, pick up.


Special cases:
- 2/3 chaining: these can be chained indefinitely, and the player at the end picks up the total value of the chain!
- 2/3 chaining: a 2 can be chained onto a 3 (or vica-verca) only if the cards share the same suit. e.g. a 2-of-hearts can be played on top
