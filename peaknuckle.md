Peaknuckle rules
----------------

The goal:
Each player is trying to get rid of all the cards in their hands. Taking turns in clockwise order, they can put one card down per turn into the discard pile if it matches either the number or suit of the top card. If you can't go on your turn, pick up a card from the deck. Special cards change the rules, they are listed below.

Setup:
The dealer deals 7 cards each in the normal fashion, then puts the deck in the center of the table, turning over the top card to begin the game.

Peaknuckle:
If you have one card left you must declare 'Peaknuckle', or knock on the table with your knucle. You have from the moment you play your penultimate card, until the next player plays a card to declare. If another player catches you, pick up a card immediately!

Special cards:
- 2: next player picks up 2 cards. If they have a 2, they can instead pass the penalty to the next player, who must pick up 4.
- 3: same rule as 2, but the next player picks up 3 cards!
- 7: change suit. this can be played on top of any card (unless special rules are in effect).
- 10: next player misses a go. If the next player has a 10, they can cancel the penalty, passing on the missed turn.
- Jack: reverse turn order (clockwise / anti-clockwise).
- King: take another turn immediately. Normal rules apply. If you can't play a card, pick up.


Special cases:
- 2/3 chaining: these can be chained indefinitely, and the player at the end picks up the total value of the chain!
- 2/3 chaining: a 2 can be chained onto a 3 (or vica-verca) only if the cards share the same suit. e.g. a 2-of-hearts can be played on top of a 3-of-hearts. The next player picks up 5!
- A 7 can be used to cancel a previous players 7
- Can you go out on a 7?
- if the first card in the game is a special card, treat it as a normal card.
- if you run out of cards in the deck, retain the top card of the discard pile and shuffle the rest into a new deck.
